# TUbe-dl
Is a simple tool to download videos or playlists from [TUbe](https://portal.tuwien.tv). 
Since TUbe is powered by [Planet eStream](https://www.planetestream.co.uk/) this might work for other Planet eStream platforms as well.

## Requirements
 - Python v3.6 or higher
 - Some basic confidence in working with the terminal and IT knowledge
 - Access to TUbe

## Installation
Installation is performed via git by cloning this repository. 
Then you have to ensure that you have installed all the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AntiKippi/TUbe-dl.git
$ cd TUbe-dl
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that the `TUbe-dl.py` script is ready to use.

## Usage
To download a video or playlist you need to specify the URL (`-u`), the directory to put the video(s) in (`-o`) and the "Cookie" header (`-c`) used to access the site.

For a full description of all available options see `TUbe-dl.py -h`.
